WeatherPy uses an OpenWeatherMap API call to retrieve weather data and contains scatter plots to demonstrate how latitude correlates with temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Linear regression is computed for these metrics in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

VacationPy uses a GeoApify API call and hvplot to create a map that displays the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the specfied coordinates for every city that matches certain weather conditions.
